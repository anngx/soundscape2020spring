In this preview, I am trying to recreate the environment of a night club through layering various 
sounds. Music, human conversation, as well as unintelligible talking noises are included in the 
audio clip. There is more to be added in between these two sections, but the next section that I 
jumped to while experimenting was the scene leading up to the beginning of the altercation. I have 
downloaded some sounds of punches, swings, kicks, and others of the sort to later put together into 
a fight scene which takes place in the alley right outside of the night club. In addition, I downloaded 
several sound clips of gunfire. I think that if I am able to integrate the gunfire noises correctly, 
it will really add some dramatic effect to the soundscape narrative as well as tension to the fight scene. 
If I add a fight scene that incorporates the sound of gunfire, I could build off of that and create a 
scene in which the ambulance and police are called, and people are being rushed to the hospital because 
of gunshot wounds. Now that I think of it, this might be the direction that my soundscape narrative takes. 
Not only will it make for an intense soundscape, but it would bring attention to the sad reality of gun 
violence in America. I think that perhaps such a story and message would be better told through a single person. I want to add breathing noises so that the listener feels as though they are following the one person, presumably the gunman, as he walks through the night club. I think this will add gorey and also perverse feeling to the soundscape. Since my goal for any art that I make is to have a high emotional impact, I think telling the story in this way will maximize that.
